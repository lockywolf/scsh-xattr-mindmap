# Scsh Xattr Mindmap

Drawing mindmaps from you File System with scsh and xattrs.



* TODO Concept

I like the idea of visualising concepts, while computers are notoriously non-visual by default. For my own purposes, I wanted to find a tool to visualise at least the data on my own hard drive.

Mind-mapping is one of the most famous methods of doing that, along with the tag cloud.
I tried various tools for mind mapping, including xmind, and others, but found them to be too heavy.
